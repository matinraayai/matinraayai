# About Me
I'm a PhD student at [Northeastern University](https://northeastern.edu) studying Computer Engineering. I work at [Northeastern University's Computer Architecture Lab](https://ece.northeastern.edu/groups/nucar/) advised under [Dr. David Kaeli](https://ece.northeastern.edu/fac-ece/kaeli.html).
<!-- - I'm also involved with [Arrow DX](https://arrowdx.com/), a start up that works that uses Artificial Intelligence and Nanotechnology to enhance detection of various diseases. -->

<!-- # Areas of Interest
I have a diverse set of interests in computer science/electrical engineering; An exhaustive list of what interests me:
- Novel Deep Learning approaches and their applications in Computer Vision (Neural Architecture Search, Generative Models, Graph Neural Networks, etc)
- Structured Pruning and Quantization of Deep Learning Models for usage on edge devices like mobile phones
- Reinforcement Learning as of recently
- Pytorch (Implementation of Auto-differentiation and Tensor Computation Frameworks)
- High Performance Computing and its Applications
- General Purpose Graphical Processing Unit Programming (CUDA, OpenCL, HIP)
- Operating Systems
- Hardware Architecture
- Anything Virtualization:
  - Level 1 Hypervisors (Xen Project)
  - Qubes OS
  - Container Technology
  - Binary Translators (QEMU)
  - GPU Time-sharing/passthrough for Virtual Machines
- Selenium Webdriver and Its applications in creating botnets
- Reverse Engineering of Binaries as of recently
- The Scala programming langauge and its usages in Spark, Deeplearning4j, and Chisel
- The new C++ programming Language standards
- The Julia programming language -->

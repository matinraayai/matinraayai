# About Me
- I'm a Masters student at Northeastern University studying Electrical and Computer Engineering with a concentration in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Algorithms.
- I'm currently a research assistant at Northeastern University's Computer Architecture Lab studying under Dr. David Kaeli.
- I'm also working with [Harvard Visual Computing Group](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/) on some unfinished projects from my co-op in 2018.

# Areas of Interest
I have a diverse set of interests in computer science/electrical engineering; A non-exhaustive list of what interests me:
- Novel Deep Learning approaches and their applications in Computer Vision (Neural Architecture Search, Generative Models, Graph Neural Networks, etc)
- Structured Pruning and Quantization of Deep Learning Models for usage on edge devices like mobile phones
- Reinforcement Learning as of recently
- Pytorch (Implementation of Auto-differentiation and Tensor Computation Frameworks)
- High Performance Computing and its Applications
- General Purpose Graphical Processing Unit Programming (CUDA, OpenCL)
- Operating Systems
- Hardware Architecture
- Anything Virtualization:
  - Level 1 Hypervisors
  - Qubes OS
  - Container Technology
  - Binary Translators (QEMU)
  - GPU Time-sharing for Virtual Machines
- Selenium Webdriver and Its applications in creating botnets
- Reverse Engineering of Binaries
# What I'm currently Working On:
Here are some of the things I'm working on right now:
- My Masters Thesis, in predicting how photons progress in Monte-carlo simulated images for the MCX project to save on computation time.
- Automatic Artifact Removal in Electron Microscope Images, in collaboration with [Harvard Visual Computing Group](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/), a continouation of my work on [Pre-processing EM Images](https://www.github.com/donglaiw/EM-preprocess).
